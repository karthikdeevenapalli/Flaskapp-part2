## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

- Initially, local images were not loading due to incorrect folder structure and filename issues (e.g., spaces in file names).
- Getting the card flip animation to feel smooth and natural took CSS experimentation with `transform` and `backface-visibility`.
- Styling cards dynamically by category required careful logic to keep the flip and colors in sync.
- Used manual asset management instead of links to ensure better load consistency and appearance.
